# SDD Group Coursework
1. The application has three different screens: one for students, one for activities coordinator and one for the tutor

2. There is no need to have a login functionality as this goes beyond the scope of this coursework. You only need to have three screens available and let the user choose which screen to access.

3. Information about each extracurricular activity (e.g., the location, time, etc.) do not need to be stored in the system. The system only keeps a list of available activities and the students enrolled in each, as outlined in the coursework brief.
